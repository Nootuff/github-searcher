Github searcher plan

Prompt: Build a simple single-page app using React, using whatever way you choose for styling. The app should have a search input that looks for a username using the Github API and displays a card with that user's most relevant information such as username, profile pic, URL and repos.

Handle errors or users not found by displaying a suitable message.


•	Components - In app have the base component "searcher", within this have "SearchForm" and "ResultCard" the card should be not shown to begin with. 
•	Error message if nothing found. If possible make the error message a component.
•	Result card should have a list of their repos, functioning urls

•	Can you get a live demo working on netlify?

•	Use mui to style, if there is time left
